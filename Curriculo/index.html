                <p>
                    As a Data Domain Leader, I drive enterprise-wide data governance, ensuring consistency,
                    accessibility, and quality across all domains. I lead strategic initiatives to implement robust
                    governance frameworks, define business data standards, and enforce compliance with organizational
                    data policies.
                    I manage cross-functional data projects, guide teams, and serve as a reference in resolving complex
                    data challenges. My role includes authorizing secure data access, promoting adherence to Data Golden
                    Rules, and designing scalable processes that support operational excellence.
                    With deep expertise in data management, I regularly deliver internal trainings to foster data
                    literacy and empower teams. I apply independent judgment to navigate ambiguity, influence
                    decision-making, and deliver impactful results in areas such as data quality, privacy, and
                    compliance.
